This OneDrive hyperlink contains the code for this assignment and all the files needed to run the code. (including files already on GitHub)

Due to size limitations on GitHub uploads, only .pkl, .json, and some .bin files are present on GitHub.

I recommend downloading all the files directly from the OneDrive link, which is all the files in the RC11_23160576_FinalAssignmentJulian folder. Then, move all files from the 'github' folder to the path RC11_23160576_FinalAssignmentJulian. Keep the positions of other folders and files unchanged. Once your folder structure looks like this, you should be able to run final_RC11_23160576.ipynb smoothly.
